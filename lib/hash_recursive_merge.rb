module HashRecursiveMerge

  #
  # Recursive version of Hash#merge!
  # 
  # Adds the contents of +other_hash+ to +hsh+, 
  # merging entries in +hsh+ with duplicate keys with those from +other_hash+.
  # 
  # Compared with Hash#merge!, this method supports nested hashes.
  # When both +hsh+ and +other_hash+ contains an entry with the same key,
  # it merges and returns the values from both arrays.
  # 
  #    h1 = {"a" => 100, "b" => 200, "c" => {"c1" => 12, "c2" => 14}}

  #    
  # Simply using Hash#merge! would return
  #

  # If the value of a given key is a Hash and both +other_hash+ and +hsh
  # includes the same key, the value is merged instead of being replaced with
  # +other_hash+ value.
