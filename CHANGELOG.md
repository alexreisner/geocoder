* Improve SQLite's distance calculation heuristic.
* Fix: Geocoder::Calculations.geographic_center was modifying its argument in-place (reported by github.com/joelmats).
* Fix: sort 'near' query results by distance when using SQLite.
* Clean up input: search for coordinates as a string with space after comma yields zero results from Google. Now we get rid of any such space before sending the query.
* DEPRECATION: Geocoder.near should not take <tt>:limit</tt> or <tt>:offset</tt> options.
* DEPRECATION: Change argument format of all methods that take lat/lon as separate arguments. Now you must pass the coordinates as an array [lat,lon], but you may alternatively pass a address string (will look up coordinates) or a geocoded object (or any object that implements a to_coordinates method which returns a [lat,lon] array).

* DEPRECATION: +fetch_address+ no longer takes an argument.
